# EDA Rotten Tomatoes

Exploratory data analysis with hierarchical clustering on data from Rotten Tomatoes about Jake Gyllenhaalâ€™s movies.

## Data

In the `code` directory there's auxiliary code that can be used to gather data from the Rotten Tomatoes website:  

Run `import_data()` with the name of the actor/actress/filme director that you  want to analyze and the file `data/movies.csv` will be generated. Data about Jake Gyllenhaal has been gathered in the aforementioned fashion.

## Execution

The R notebooks reside in the *notebooks* directory, and ideally should be run under the Rstudio IDE.
